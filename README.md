## About

### Description and Purpose

Recipe Guru is a smart recipe suggestion system designed to help users find recipes based on the ingredients they have available and their dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free). The system uses AI to provide tailored recipe suggestions, helping users maximize the use of available ingredients while considering dietary restrictions. Users can save their favorite recipes, view their search history, and manage their profiles. This tool is aimed at enhancing the cooking experience by offering intelligent recipe recommendations.


### Inspiration

The idea behind Recipe Guru was born from the need for a user-friendly tool to make cooking easier by suggesting recipes tailored to the ingredients users have on hand, while also accommodating dietary needs. By leveraging AI and real-time data, Recipe Guru brings convenience and customization to cooking.
